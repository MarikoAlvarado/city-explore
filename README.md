# Project Name

**Author**: Kjell Overholt & Mariko Alvarado
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

We are building this application so that users can search a city by name and in return get information about that city.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Create a new repository with applicable set up files
2. Set up a server
3. Set up routes to .json files for data
4. Build HTML
5. Pull express server to Heroku
6. Deploy site through Heroku


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

- HTML

- CSS

- JS

- JQUERY

- NODE.JS

1. When a user searches a city from client, a request will be sent to the server. 

2. The server will use the search to retrieve data for the specific city from JSON file.

3. JSON data will be returned to server

4. Server will return data to the client side to be rendered.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.

## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->


1. Draw the web request response cycle for the task at hand (about 15 minutes).
   1. Document the data flow: identify inputs and outputs for each part of the cycle.
   1. Outline the functions that support this data flow.
